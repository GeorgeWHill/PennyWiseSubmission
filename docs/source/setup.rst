Setup
=====

- The project setup and execution instructions assume a Unix-like environment (Linux/macOS). For Windows, the activation command for the virtual environment is slightly different (`venv\Scripts\activate`).
- Always ensure that your Python and Node.js environments are correctly set up and that the versions meet the project's requirements.
